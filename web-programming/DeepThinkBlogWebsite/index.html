                    <p>During this difficult time, it's important to continue looking after your physical 
                    and mental health. This will not only help you in the long-term, it will also help 
                    you fight COVID-19 if you get it.</p>

                    <p>First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly. Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks. Third, don't smoke. Smoking can increase your risk of developing severe disease if
                    you become infected with COVID-19. Fourth, exercise.</p>
