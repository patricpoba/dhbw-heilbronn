            "question": "How is a blood sample collected?", 
            "answer": "Typically, a blood sample is taken by inserting a needle into a vein, usually in your arm. Before your blood is drawn, an elastic band is tied around your upper arm to increase blood in the veins, and the puncture location is wiped clean with an antiseptic."

            "question": "How is a urine sample collected?",

            "question": "Can cancer be detected with a blood test?", 
            "answer": "Blood tests cannot definitively tell whether or not a person has cancer. However, some blood cancers may be detected if there are abnormal findings on a complete blood count (CBC)"

        {
            "question": "What is the difference between a screening test and a diagnostic test?", 
            "answer": "Screening tests are laboratory tests that can help detect a disease even before a person develops symptoms, usually in the earliest and most treatable stages. Screening tests are also used to help to identify people who have an increased risk for a condition so that preventive measures can be taken. Examples of these tests include cholesterol testing for heart disease risk, HIV testing, and Pap smears for cervical cancer."
